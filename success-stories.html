                <p class="text-gray-700 italic">"Choosing EduOverseaz was the best decision I made for my future. I was confused about which country and university would suit my career goals, but their team sat with me for hours, understanding my profile and aspirations. They helped me get admission to my dream MBA program in Toronto and guided me through the entire visa process. The support didn't stop there — they even helped me find accommodation and connected me with other Indian students already studying there.
